# **Backstage - A lot more goes behind an event**

Backstage is a comprehensive platform designed to help event organizers efficiently manage every aspect of their events. From the planning stage to execution and post-event services, our platform ensures that everything runs smoothly behind the scenes. Whether you're managing large conferences, concerts, or private events, Backstage is equipped to handle the complexity that goes into organizing a successful event.

The application includes integrations with microservices that facilitate email notifications, machine learning-based predictions, and more, helping streamline operations and improve decision-making.

### **Objective:**

The main goal of Backstage is to **simplify the work of event managers** by providing a seamless, unified solution for managing tasks, logistics, and teams, boosting their confidence and enabling them to work more efficiently.

### **Target Audience:**
